## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- API requests
- Query strings
- Mobile first design
- Accessibility focus design
- Responsive design

### What I learned

On this project, I repeated my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I learned how to work with API requests and queries for specific data and how to work with this data to return what the user wants. Last but not least, I learned how to copy data to a clipboard.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to add a toggle button that would allow the user to choose which (light or dark) mode they prefer. Currently the mode setting responds to the user's browser and system settings.
