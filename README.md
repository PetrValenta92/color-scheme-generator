## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile first design
- Accessibility focus design
- Responsive design
- Javascript modules
- Javascript classes

### What I learned

I learned to split my javascript code into modules. I also learned how to export and import data from a database file and further work with it using JS classes.

### Continued development

I would like to expand the database with more profiles in the future. If a user exhausted all profiles, he/she could have all profiles he/she liked and rejected displayed.
